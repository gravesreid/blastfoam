# Building 3-D tutorial

## Notes

This case is designed to show a simple 3-D case setup using an STL file with snappyHexMesh and adaptive mesh refinement. A c-4 charge is placed inside an L-Shaped building. The c-4 is activated using the linear activation model.

The case takes approximately 5 min to run on a four-core desktop.
